# Session & Term Synchronization Fix

## Problem Description

The session and term manager was not affecting all dashboard pages consistently. When changing sessions or terms:
- Some pages would update immediately
- Others would not update until page reload
- The synchronization between global and local contexts was incomplete
- Dashboard components were not automatically refreshing their data

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Circular Dependency**: The synchronization between `GlobalAcademicContext` and `AcademicContext` was creating circular updates
2. **Missing Event Propagation**: Changes in global context weren't properly propagating to all dashboard components
3. **Incomplete Context Updates**: Local contexts weren't immediately refreshing when global context changed
4. **No Automatic Page Refresh**: Dashboard pages weren't automatically refreshing their data

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced GlobalAcademicSync Component
- **File**: `src/lib/global-academic-sync.tsx`
- **Improvements**:
  - Added immediate context refresh when global context changes
  - Added force page refresh events
  - Added dashboard context change events
  - Improved synchronization logic to prevent circular dependencies

### 2. Enhanced GlobalAcademicContext
- **File**: `src/contexts/GlobalAcademicContext.tsx`
- **Improvements**:
  - Added multiple event triggers for different types of updates
  - Added dashboard-specific context change events
  - Added force page refresh events
  - Enhanced event propagation to all dashboard routes

### 3. New useDashboardRefresh Hook
- **File**: `src/lib/use-dashboard-refresh.ts`
- **Purpose**: Automatically refresh dashboard data when academic context changes
- **Features**:
  - Listens for academic context changes
  - Automatically refreshes page data
  - Forces page reloads when needed
  - Handles different types of refresh events

### 4. Enhanced AcademicContext
- **File**: `src/lib/academic-context.tsx`
- **Improvements**:
  - Added event listeners for global context changes
  - Added automatic refresh when global context changes
  - Improved synchronization with global context

### 5. Updated Dashboard Layouts
- **Files**: 
  - `src/app/dashboard/admin/layout.tsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/student/layout.tsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/teacher/layout.tsx`
- **Improvements**:
  - Added `useDashboardRefresh` hook to all layouts
  - Ensures automatic refresh when context changes

### 6. Context Sync Status Component
- **File**: `src/components/academic-context/ContextSyncStatus.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Monitor synchronization status between global and local contexts
- **Features**:
  - Real-time sync status display
  - Visual indicators for sync state
  - Debugging information for developers

## How It Works Now

### 1. Session/Term Change Flow
```
User changes session/term → GlobalAcademicContext updates → 
Multiple events triggered → All dashboard components refresh → 
Data synchronized across all pages
```

### 2. Event Types
- `academicContextChanged`: Triggers context refresh
- `forcePageRefresh`: Forces page reload
- `dashboardContextChanged`: Triggers dashboard-specific updates
- `refreshPageData`: Triggers component data refresh

### 3. Automatic Synchronization
- All dashboard layouts now automatically listen for context changes
- Components using `useAcademicContext` automatically refresh
- Components using `useGlobalAcademicContext` get immediate updates
- Page data is automatically refreshed when context changes

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Session Change
1. Go to any dashboard page
2. Change the session using the GlobalAcademicSwitcher
3. Verify that all dashboard pages show the new session
4. Check that data is filtered by the new session

### 2. Test Term Change
1. Go to any dashboard page
2. Change the term using the GlobalAcademicSwitcher
3. Verify that all dashboard pages show the new term
4. Check that data is filtered by the new term

### 3. Test Page Navigation
1. Change session/term on one dashboard page
2. Navigate to other dashboard pages
3. Verify that the new session/term is active everywhere
4. Check that no page reload is required

### 4. Monitor Sync Status
1. Use the ContextSyncStatus component on admin dashboard
2. Change session/term and watch the sync status
3. Verify that status shows "synced" after changes
4. Check that last sync time updates

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Immediate Updates**: All dashboard pages update immediately when session/term changes
✅ **No Page Reload Required**: Changes persist across page navigation
✅ **Consistent Data**: All components show data for the selected session/term
✅ **Automatic Sync**: No manual intervention needed to keep contexts in sync
✅ **Cross-Dashboard Consistency**: Changes affect admin, teacher, and student dashboards equally

## Troubleshooting

### If synchronization still doesn't work:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Context Providers**: Ensure all layouts have proper context providers
3. **Check Event Listeners**: Verify that events are being dispatched and received
4. **Monitor Network**: Check if API calls are being made when context changes
5. **Use Sync Status Component**: Monitor the ContextSyncStatus component for debugging

### Common Issues:

1. **Missing Context Provider**: Ensure `GlobalAcademicContextProvider` wraps the entire app
2. **Missing useDashboardRefresh**: Ensure all dashboard layouts use the hook
3. **Event Listener Conflicts**: Check for conflicting event listeners
4. **API Response Issues**: Verify that API endpoints return correct data

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/global-academic-sync.tsx` - Enhanced synchronization logic
- `src/contexts/GlobalAcademicContext.tsx` - Improved event propagation
- `src/lib/use-dashboard-refresh.ts` - New refresh hook
- `src/lib/academic-context.tsx` - Added event listeners
- `src/app/dashboard/admin/layout.tsx` - Added refresh hook
- `src/app/dashboard/student/layout.tsx` - Added refresh hook
- `src/app/dashboard/teacher/layout.tsx` - Added refresh hook
- `src/components/academic-context/ContextSyncStatus.tsx` - New sync status component

## Conclusion

The session and term synchronization issue has been resolved through a comprehensive approach that ensures:
- Immediate updates across all dashboard pages
- Automatic synchronization between global and local contexts
- No manual page reloads required
- Consistent behavior across all dashboard types

The solution maintains the existing architecture while adding robust synchronization mechanisms that ensure all components stay in sync with academic context changes.
